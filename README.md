# GradleMCPBase
Gradle MCP for 1.8.9 with optifine

# How to setup
Clone the repository into whatever folder you want (Mine is in my coding folder), open the project in Intellij IDEA then make a new run configuration (Application)
and copy everything from the image below.

Now you can start Minecraft!

# How to build
Just run the "build" run command in the gradle tab

Once you've done that go into the build/libs directory inside of the GradleMCP-Base folder
open the jar file with 7-zip or Winrar, now delete the META-INF folder and I think you know how to
do everything to get it to start in the launcher.
